Kernan is an interpreter for the Grace language

Kernan aims to implement the language correctly and without proprietary
extensions. It is written in C# and functions on all platforms, either
natively on Windows or under Mono elsewhere.

Building
========
Windows
-------
This repository can be imported directly into Visual Studio, and builds
and runs directly. `Grace.exe` can be run directly to access the
command-line interface.

Linux and OS X
--------------
Mono is available from <http://www.mono-project.com> and includes both a
runtime and C# compiler. After obtaining and installing Mono, the
repository or an individual subproject can be compiled by running
`xbuild` in its directory. `Grace/grace` is a shell script wrapping the
command-line interface to Kernan.

Usage
=====
To run an individual Grace file, use:
    grace file.grace
with either `Grace.exe` or `Grace/grace` in your path, depending on your
platform.

There is a read-eval-print loop available with the --repl option:
    grace --repl
